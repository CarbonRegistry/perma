		<p>Once a Perma Link is created, it will be automatically stored for for two years.  At the end of that period, the Perma Link creator will have the option to renew the link for another two year period. If, at any time, you wish to preserve access to the archived content indefinitely, your link must be approved by an account affiliated with a Perma Registrar for permanent status. We call this approval process “vesting.” Once vested, a link will be forever preserved.</p>
		
		<p>While logged into a vesting account, a user simply follows the PermaLink and selects “vest” in the upper righthand corner.</p>

		<p>The goal of Perma.cc is to provide lasting links to material cited in legal scholarship, judicial opinions, and legal pedagogy.  Vesting a link is a confirmation that the link supports these goals and will be available for readers in perpetuity.  In order to further the idea of perpetual access, you may not reverse the vesting process.  If you believe a link has been vested in error, or you wish to have the link removed from public access, you can place the link in the Dark Archive.</p>

		<h4><div id="vesting-priviledges">II. Vesting Organizations &amp; Vesting Users</div></h4>
		<p>Only certain Perma accounts have vesting privileges.  Vesting organizations, such as law journals, courts, and academic legal publishers are each affiliated with a Registrar institution that has partnered with Perma to preserve links created specifically to support judicial opinions, legal scholarship, and legal pedagogy.  These Registrars can vouch for the authenticity of affiliated vesting organizations and help prevent abuse of the PermaLink functionality.</p>
