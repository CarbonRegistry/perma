			<h2 class="body-ah">Perma.cc Basics</h2>
			<h3 id="account-holders" class="body-bh" class="body-bh">Account-holders</h3>
			<p class="body-text">Perma.cc has three categories of account-holders: (1) registrar users; (2) vesting users; (3) general users. Each category has different authorities and responsibilities.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><em><strong><span id="registrar-users">Registrar users</span></strong></em> are people who work at libraries and other trusted institutions that have become registrars. They have vesting privileges. They help administer Perma.cc, and they decide which other users and organizations receive vesting privileges. For example, the Harvard Law School Library is a registrar. Some members of the Library staff are registrar users. They grant vesting privileges to new journals and faculty, and they help all of the Harvard Law School journals and faculty members who use Perma.cc. </p>
			<p class="body-text"><em><strong><span id="vesting-users">Vesting users</span></strong></em> are people who belong to journals or other organizations that have been granted vesting privileges by libraries. They can vest links on behalf of their organizations, and they can add and remove other vesting users on behalf of their organizations. For example, the <em>Harvard Law Review</em> is a vesting organization. Several of its editors are vesting users. They vest the links cited in published articles, and they decide when to add new vesting users to the Law Review (such as when the new class of editors is selected), or when to remove vesting users from the Law Review (such as when a class of editors graduates).<p class="body-text">
			<p class="body-text"><em><strong><span id="general-users">General users</span></strong></em> are individuals with Perma.cc accounts, who aren't affiliated with a vesting organization or registrar. General users can create and manage their own links, but they can't vest their links. <p class="body-text">

		<h3 id="create-account" class="body-bh" class="body-bh">Creating an account</h3>
			<p class="body-text">To use Perma.cc to preserve online sources, you'll need to create an account. It's easy. Just <a href="{% url 'sign_up' %}">click here</a> or find the <kbd>Create An Account</kbd> button on the home page:</p>
			
			<img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}img/docs/screenshot_home.png" class="img-resdponsive screen-shot" alt="A screenshot of the landing page."/>
	
			<p class="body-text">Then enter your email, first and last name. And please read the <a href="{% url 'terms_of_service' %}">terms of service</a>!</p>
			
			<img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}img/docs/screenshot_create_account.png" class="img-responsive screen-shot" alt="A screnshot of the registration page."/>
			
			<!--<p class="body-text">If your chosen account information is available (not already taken by another user), you will see a confirmation page and receive an email at the account you specified. Please follow the instructions in the email to activate your account. If the system indicates that your email address has already been assigned to another user, it is possible that someone in your institution has already added you as a user.  You can use the password reset option and your email address to claim your account.</p>
			
			<img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}img/email-account.gif" class="img-responsive screen-shot" alt="Responsive image"/>
			
			<p class="body-text">If you are affiliated with a law library, academic law journal, or court system, you may receive an email that an account has been created for you.  Follow the instructions in that email to activate your account, which will be affiliated with your particular institution including the power to vest links if assigned to you.</p>-->
		<h3 id="navigating-account" class="body-bh" class="body-bh">Navigating your account</h3>
			<p class="body-text">When you log in to Perma, you’ll see the Perma dropdown menu in the upper right corner of the screen. From this menu you can navigate to your links, to various user management pages (if you're a registrar user or vesting user), and to our tools and settings pages.</p>
	
			<img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}img/docs/screenshot_dropdown.png" class="img-responsive screen-shot" alt="A screenshot of the Perma dropdown menu."/>
	
			<p class="body-text">The <em>My Links</em> page gives you quick access to all of the links you've created. If you're a member of a vesting organization or registrar, you'll also see all the links associated with your organization. From this page, you can <a href="#annotating-links">annotate</a> links and <a href="#organizing-links">organize</a> them into folders according to your or your organization's preferences.</p>
	
			<img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}img/docs/screenshot_my_links.png" class="img-responsive screen-shot" alt="A screenshot of the Create an Archive page."/>
	
	
		<h3 id="creating-links" class="body-bh" class="body-bh">Creating links</h3>
	
			<p class="body-text">To make a Perma Link, just enter the source URL and click the button. Perma will visit the web page at your direction and create a record of the contents of that page.</p>	
			
			<p class="body-text">The entry box accepts multiple formats, including www and https://.</p>
	
			<img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}img/docs/screenshot-create-link.png" class="img-responsive screen-shot" alt="A screenshot of the Create an Archive page with the URL of a potential archive."/>
			
			<p class="body-text">Once processing is done, Perma will display a "Success!" message, a thumbnail image of the preserved page and the new Perma Link (such as perma.cc/ABCD-1234). You should review the thumbnail image and click on the new Perma Link to confirm that the new record displays accurately.</p> 
			
			<img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}img/docs/screenshot-success.png" class="img-responsive screen-shot" alt="A screenshot of a Create an Archive page with a newly created archive. Includes the URL and the thumbnail preview."/>
	
			<p class="red">Important Note: At this point, you’ve created a temporary record. It must be vested to become permanent. <a href="#vesting-links">Click here to learn more about vesting.</a></p>
	
			<p class="body-text">If preservation fails for some reason, Perma.cc will display a "Failure" message and give you the option to upload your own screenshots (.png, .jpg) or PDF documents.</p>
	
		<h3 id="archive-formats" class="body-bh" class="body-bh">Archive formats</h3>
	
			<p class="body-text">Perma provides multiple archive formats for each archived web page: (1) live page view, (2) screen capture and (3) archived page. You can navigate through the different formats using the tabs at the top of each page. </p>
	
			<p class="body-text">In the "live page view," you’ll see the live, present-day contents of the original source URL. This view, which is not an archive, allows you to check quickly to see if the original page is still live and, if so, you can navigate directly to the live site. </p>
	
			<img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}img/docs/live-page2.gif" class="img-responsive screen-shot" alt="A screenshot of the Perma archive page, highlighting the Live page view tab."/>
	
			<p class="body-text">If the live page view reveals a 404 error or the original web page has changed, you can use the tabs to select among available archive formats for the cited web page.</p>
			
			<p class="body-text">If you select the "screen capture" tab, you’ll see a screenshot of the original web page as it appeared when the Perma Link was created.</p>
			
			<p class="body-text">If you select the "archived page" tab, you’ll see an interactive archive of the cited web page as it appeared when the Perma Link was created.</p>
	
		<h3 id="darchive" class="body-bh" class="body-bh">Dark archive</h3>
	
			<p class="body-text">Most of the materials archived by Perma users are publicly accessible to anyone who clicks the associated Perma Link or enters the URL for that Perma Link into their browser. </p>
	
			<p class="body-text">Some of the materials archived by Perma users become part of a dark archive, which means they are preserved but not widely accessible. These materials remain available to the person who created the Perma Link. Once vested, these materials also are available to the vesting user, vesting organization and registrar responsible for the vesting decision. When a reader encounters something in the dark archive, they'll see this screen, which invites them to contact a participating librarian for help acccessing the archived materials:</p>
	
			<img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}img/docs/screenshot_darchive.png" class="img-responsive screen-shot" alt="A screenshot a Perma dark archive page."/></p>
	
			<p class="body-text">Materials may become part of the dark archive for different reasons. The person who created or vested a Perma Link may designate it for the dark archive. Also, by default, Perma places in the dark archive any pages with a “noarchive” metatag or a Perma-specific exclusion in the robots.txt file. Finally, archived materials are placed in the dark archive upon receipt of a valid DMCA takedown notice.</p>
			
		<h3 id="vesting-links" class="body-bh" class="body-bh">Vesting links</h3>
	
			<p class="body-text">Each link starts out as unvested and temporary. Perma will maintain these links for at least two years after they're made. Then Perma will give you the option to renew the record for another temporary period, after which it will expire. Unvested links have a large orange banner and stopwatch icon to make it clear to everyone that they are temporary and will expire:</p>
	
			<img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}img/docs/screenshot_temp_warning.png" class="img-responsive screen-shot" alt="A screenshot of the temporary link banner."/>
	
			<p class="body-text">A link must be vested to become permanent. A user with vesting privileges simply needs to visit the link, review the archived material and click the green <kbd>Vest site</kbd> button in the upper right corner of the screen.</p>
							
			<p class="body-text">After clicking "Vest," the user will be prompted to assign the vested link to the appropriate Vesting Organization and folder for that organization. Once vested, a Perma Link cannot be deleted by users.</p>
	
		<h3 id="organizing-links" class="body-bh" class="body-bh">Organizing links</h3>
	
			<p class="body-text">You can organize your links into folders. Just select "My links" from the dropdown menu to access your folders. From this view you can add folders, delete folders, rename folders, and drag-and-drop links into the right folders. If you're a <a href="#registrar-users">registrar user</a> or <a href="#vesting-users">vesting user</a>, you'll have access to all the folders for your organization:</p>
	
			<img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}img/docs/screenshot_my_links.png" class="img-responsive screen-shot" alt="A screenshot of the Create an Archive page."/>
	
			<p class="body-text">Note that once a link is vested, it can't be moved from vesting organization's folders to another.</p>
	
		<h3 id="annotating-links" class="body-bh" class="body-bh">Annotating links</h3>
	
			<p class="body-text">You can annotate any link accessible to you. Just select "My links" from the dropdown menu, click on the right folder, and then click the "More" button on the item you want to annotate. The item will expand to display more details about the link. From this view you can edit the title, add notes, move the link to another folder and view other metadata about the link:</p>
	
			<img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}img/docs/screenshot_annotate.png" class="img-responsive screen-shot" alt="A screenshot of the link metadata view."/>
	
		<h3 id="using-links" class="body-bh" class="body-bh">Using links</h3>
	
			<p class="body-text">How you use the links in citations is really up to you. We like it when journals include the original citation and the Perma Link, like this:</p>
	
			<img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}img/examples/HLR_2.gif" class="img-responsive screen-shot" alt="An example from the Harvard Law Review" />
	
			<p class="body-text">But that's not the only way to do it. The key is to make it easy for your readers to find the source when the original link rots.</p>
