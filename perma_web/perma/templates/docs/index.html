			<h2>Introducing Perma.cc</h2>
			<h3 id="what-is-perma">What is Perma.cc?</h3>
			<p>Perma.cc is a service that helps prevent link rot.</p>
			
			<p>Link rot (and “reference rot”) happens when you cite to an online source that later disappears or changes. It's a big problem, especially for academic scholarship and judicial opinions, which depend heavily on citations to stable sources that readers can access. For example, a <a href="http://perma.cc/48QZ-DT6L">study</a> conducted by researchers at Harvard Law School found that more than 70% of the links in a sample of law journals and 50% of the links in Supreme Court opinions no longer work.</p>
			
			<p>Perma.cc and its <a href="{% url 'about' %}">consortium of participating libraries</a> are working to solve this problem.</p>
			<h3 id="what-does-perma-do">What does Perma.cc do?</h3>
			<p>You tell Perma.cc the web address you want to preserve and cite. Our software goes to that web address, preserves what's there, deposits it into our collection, and gives you a unique URL (e.g. "perma.cc/ABCD-1234") that points to the record in our collection. You then can use that link in your citation so that your readers can get to a stable, accurate record of the source you referenced, even if the original source disappears from the web.</p>
			
			<h3 id="example-perma">Perma.cc example</h3>
			<p>Suppose you're a law professor working on an article and you want to cite to the FBI's <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/wanted/topten">Top Ten Most Wanted List</a>. Because that list changes over time, your citation is going to rot and your future readers won't be able to access your actual source at the original URL. That's bad for you and your readers.</p>
			<p>But if you give Perma.cc the web address - e.g. <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/wanted/topten">http://www.fbi.gov/wanted/topten</a> - our software will visit the page, make a record of it and give you a unique URL that points to the preserved record - e.g. <a class="perma" href="https://perma.cc/T8U2-994F?type=source">perma.cc/T8U2-994F</a>.</p>
			<p>If you have vesting privileges, you can vest the link yourself. Or, when you submit your article for publication, the publishing journal can vest the link. At that point, the link can be added to your citation, and your future readers will be able to access the intended source no matter what happens to the original web page.</p>

			<h2>For Journals, Courts, and Other Vesting Organizations</h2>
			
			<h3 id="becoming-vesting-org">Becoming a vesting org</h3>
			<p>If you're with an academic institution, simply contact your library and ask if it is a Perma.cc registrar. If your library isn't yet a registrar, ask them to contact us at <a href="mailto:info@perma.cc">info@perma.cc</a> about joining Perma.cc as a registrar. If you're part of a court or other governmental entity, please contact us directly and we'll help you get started.</p>  
			
			<h3 id="journals-authority">Authority and responsibilities</h3>
			<p>Vesting orgs can vest links and confer (and withdraw) vesting authority. Typically a vesting org is a collection of vesting users working together on a journal, for a faculty member or for a court. A vesting org is responsible for ensuring that its vesting users do not abuse their vesting authority. Every link vested by anyone within your vesting org becomes automatically associated with the vesting org, so it's important that you exercise judgment about who can be a vesting user and what vesting activities are appropriate. If you like, you can adopt policies and best practices for Perma.cc usage by those in your organization.<p>
			<p>Within a vesting org, every vesting user has access to all of the links vested on behalf of the org. This lets vesting org members work collaboratively and to organize links across the organization. It also means every member's vesting activities are visible to all the other members of the vesting org.</p> 
			
			<h3 id="adding-vesting-users">Adding and removing vesting users</h3>
			<p>Every vesting user within a vesting org has the ability to add or remove vesting users on behalf of the organization. Each organization should decide for itself, in consultation with its registrar, how it wants to manage the addition and removal of vesting users.</p>
			<p>To add new vesting users, just click on "Manage users" in the dropdown menu and select "Vesting users." Click "add new" to trigger the vesting user form, enter the email address of the person you want to add, and click the "add" button.</p>
			<p>To remove vesting users from your vesting org, just click on "Manage users" in the dropdown menu, find the person's name in your list of vesting users, and click "edit/remove," which will take you to an edit screen. From that screen you can remove the user from your vesting org.<p>
