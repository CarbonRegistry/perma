		<h4><div id="formats">Archive Formats</div></h4>
		<p>Perma provides multiple archive formats for each archived web page. You can navigate through the different formats using the tabs at the top of each page. </p>
		
		<br/>
		<pre>Live Page View<div class="highlighted-definition">The cited web page as it currently exists.</div></pre>
		
		<p>In the Live Page View, you’ll see the live, present-day contents of the original source URL. This view, which is not an archive, allows you to check quickly to see if the original page is still live and, if so, you can navigate directly to the live site. </p>
		
		<img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}img/docs/live-page2.gif" class="img-responsive screen-shot" alt="Responsive image"/>
		
		<p>If the Live Site View reveals a 404 error or the original web page has changed, you can use the tabs to select among available archive formats for the cited web page.</p>

		<br/>
		<pre>Screen Cap·ture View<br/><span class="highlighted-definition">An image of the cited webpage as it existed when the Perma Link was created.</span></pre>

				
		<p>If you select the Screen Capture tab, you’ll see a screenshot of the original web page as it appeared when the Perma Link was created. If the Perma Link is unvested, you will see a blue Perma icon overlay on the image.</p>
		
		<img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}img/docs/screen-capture2.gif" class="img-responsive screen-shot" alt="Responsive image"/>
		
		<br/>
		<pre>Ar·chived Page View<br/><span class="highlighted-definition">The webpage, rendered in html & css, with accompanying images, that best recreates the view and functionality as it existed when the Perma Link was created.</span></pre>
		
		
		<p>If you select the Archived Page tab, you’ll see an interactive archive of the cited web page as it appeared when the Perma Link was created. If the Perma Link is unvested, you will see the blue Perma icon overlay on the archived pages.</p>

		<h4><div id="dark">Dark Archive</div></h4>
		
		<pre>Dark Ar·chive<div class="highlighted-definition">A repository for content stored with Perma that is not publicly viewable.</div></pre>
		
		<p>The Dark Archive is for content stored with Perma that is not publically viewable through the website. There are several ways an item may be placed into the Dark Archive.  At the time a Perma Link is created, Perma recognizes the metatag “noarchive” as well as robots.txt instructions specific to Perma in the site source code, and Perma Links to sites with that metatag or robots.txt instruction will direct to the Dark Archive.  In addition, after a Perma Link has been created, the content will be moved to the Dark Archive upon receipt of a DMCA takedown order or at the direction of creator/vester/registrar.</p>
		
		<img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}img/docs/darchive.gif" class="img-responsive screen-shot" alt="Responsive image"/>
		
		<p>Readers that wish to obtain a copy of a resource from the Dark Archive may request one from a participating library.  Please note, however, that processing of requests for Dark Archive content is subject to your own library access privileges.</p>
	
		
		
		<!--<pre>Mir·rors<br/><span class="highlighted-definition">Our network of servers that each hold the complete perma.cc archives, duplicated to ensure fault-tolerance. </span></pre>
		
		<h4><div id="mirror">Archive Mirroring</div></h4>
		<p>Perma.cc is a service, currently in beta, that allows users to create citation links that will never break.</p>
		
		<p>When a user creates a Perma.cc link, Perma.cc archives a copy of the referenced content, and generates a link to an unalterable hosted instance of the site.  Regardless of what may happen to the original source, if the link is later published by a journal using the Perma.cc service, the archived version will always be available through the Perma.cc link.</p>-->
