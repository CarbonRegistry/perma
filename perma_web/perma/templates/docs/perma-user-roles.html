		<h4><a href="#">I. Registrar User</a></h4>
		<p>A Registrar User represents a Registrar institution (in most cases a law library or court library).  The Registrar User can create Vesting Organizations, give vesting privileges to individual users, and create general user accounts.  The Registrar User is responsible for ensuring that all Vesting Organizations are correctly affiliated with the Registrar institution and granting or revoking vesting privileges as necessary.  The Registrar User may also be called upon to answer questions about Perma for users affiliated with the Registrar institution.  Questions can also be directed to <a href="mailto:info@perma.cc">info@perma.cc</a>.</p>

		<br/>
		<h4><a href="#">II. Vesting Organization</a></h4>
		<p>Vesting Organizations are most commonly law journals and courts.  All users affiliated with a particular vesting organization can view links created by users in that organization (in progress).</p>
		
		<br/>
		<h4><a href="#">III. Vesting User</a></h4>
		<p>Vesting Users are users that are affiliated with a particular Vesting Organization.  They have all of the same authority as general users, but they can also vest individual links.  If you are a general user and would like to request vesting privileges, contact your affiliated Vesting Organization or Registrar.  You can also email <a href="mailto:info@perma.cc">info@perma.cc</a> for more information.</p>
	
		<br/>
		<h4><a href="#">IV. General User</a></h4>
		
		<p>General users can create and manage their own links, but unless those links are vested by a user with vesting privileges, they will expire a set period.  All links created by general users are maintained for a two-year period, at the end of which, the user has the option of renewing for another two-year period.</p>
