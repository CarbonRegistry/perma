TITLE: Perma.cc update for Registrars: action requested

Dear {{ first_name }} {{ last_name }}:

We're reaching out to all our registrar-partners with an update and important request. You are receiving this email because you are currently identified as a Registrar User for {{ registrar_name }}.

First, below is an overview of Perma usage by those affiliated with your institution. If you have questions about these stats and the activity levels within your entity, please contact us.

    Perma Links created (total): {{ total_links }}{% comment %}
    Perma Links created (2017): {{ somevar }}
    Your most active organization: {{ somevar }} {% endcomment %}

Second, we need to confirm the contact info for your institution and its registrar users. Currently our records show that your general contact email is {{ registrar_email }} and that you have the following contact info:

    General contact email: {{ registrar_email }}{% for user in registrar_users %}
    {{ user.first_name }} {{ user.last_name }} - {{ user.email }}{% endfor %}

If any of this information is wrong, please update your registrar user information at http://example.com and general contact email at http://example.com.

Third, we've observed that many questions sent to us by users are best addressed by their respective Registrars. In coming weeks, we'll be making it easier for Perma users in your community to connect with you when they have basic questions about Perma. This, in turn, will give you more visibility into how your community is using this service. Our team will remain focused on improving the Perma service and working directly with you to make sure that it meets your communityâ€™s needs.

Lastly, our team has prepared a short Guide to Perma.cc for Journal Editors, which we hope you and the journals you support will find helpful. A PDF of the guide is attached, and we've also posted the text at http://example.com so that you can adapt it as needed. Please feel free to share this resource with your journals.

As always, we welcome your ideas and feedback, and thank you for supporting Perma.cc!

The Perma Team
