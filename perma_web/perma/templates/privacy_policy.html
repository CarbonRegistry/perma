<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Perma is committed to safeguarding the privacy of visitors to our website, http://perma.cc (the “Site”) and users of our service (the "Service"). This Privacy Policy describes the limited manner in which we will use information that you provide us in order to offer and improve upon our Service.</p>

<h2>Important Terms Used Throughout This Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>Throughout this Privacy Policy we use several specialized terms. "Personally Identifiable Information" is information that tells us specifically who you are, like your name, street address, email address, billing address, credit card number, and expiration date. "User Information" means all Personally Identifiable Information and any other forms of information discussed in this Privacy Policy, including the Internet Protocol (“IP”) address of a user's computer. We use the term "aggregate" when we combine information from various persons or users. Information is said to be "anonymized" if it does not identify individual persons or entities or associate a particular person or entity with such information.</p>

<h2>Information We Collect and How We Use It</h2>
<p>If you visit our site to browse, we will only collect and store the domain name and host from which a user accessed the Internet (e.g., aol.com), the IP address of the user's computer, the user's browser software and operating system, the date and time the user accesses the site and the Internet address of any Web site from which the user linked directly to our site or to which the user links after visiting our site. We use this information to measure the number of visitors to sections of our sites, to determine from where our visitors linked and to where our visitors link from the sites and to help us make the Service more useful. For example, we organize and analyze IP addresses so that we can provide efficient service, enhance security, monitor appropriate usage and produce traffic volume statistics. This type of information is sometimes shared with third-parties, such as when we aggregate and disclose site traffic information for marketing purposes. When we share such information with third-parties we will require them to abide by the standards of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>To make full use of our Service, you may need to complete our registration process and create an account. We collect and store the Personally Identifiable Information you provide through this registration process, including your user ID and password. We collect and store information about when you create the account and when you log in.  If you engage in a transaction while logged on to the Site, then we collect and store information about the transaction.  If you send us communications, then we may collect such communications in a file specific to you.</p>
<p>We use information we collect from you to build features that we hope will make the Service more attractive and easier for you to use. We may share User Information with our partners and affiliates that are committed to serving your need for the Service and improving your user experience, but will require such third-parties to abide by the standards of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We may also share aggregate anonymized data relating to activity on the site and use of the Service, such as demographics and statistical information, for marketing, research and other purposes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we may need to disclose User Information to law enforcement or other government officials if appropriate for your protection or in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement or other activity that is illegal or may expose us or our users to legal liability.</p>

<h2>If You Do Not Wish to Disclose User Information</h2>
<p>If you do not want to provide us with certain User Information then you may opt out by not using the Service that provides us with such User Information. For example, if you do not want us to retain your name, then you may choose not to become a registered User. You will not be entitled to the benefits of registration, but you are still free to browse the site and to visit the parts of the site accessible to non-registrants.</p>

<h2>Local Storage</h2>
<p>The use of “local storage” permits our Site to send information to your browser for storage on your hard drive. This feature can make your use of our Site easier by saving certain aspects about your status and preferences upon visits to our Site. For example, if you create a Perma link without being logged in to a Perma account, we use local storage to save the page’s title and related metadata.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>The cookies are refreshed every time you enter the Site. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you may be able to change the settings to refuse cookies or to be alerted when cookies are being sent. We use cookies in some instances, to associate you with your User Information. For example, through the use of cookies you may log in automatically and thereby save you time. Rejection of cookies can interfere with your ability to log in and use certain parts of the Service.</p>

<h2>Control of Your Password</h2>
<p>Except as specifically permitted by this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Service, you may not disclose your Perma password to any third-parties nor share it with any third-parties. If you lose control of your Perma password you may lose control over your Personally Identifiable Information, and you will be responsible for any legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password or, if we provided your password, notify Perma so that we may issue you a new password.</p>

<h2>Underage Users</h2>
<p>Use of the service is limited to users 18 years of age and older. If we discover that we have collected any personally identifying information from a child under the age of 13, we will remove that information from our records.</p>

<h2>Third-Parties</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of User Information collected by Perma. If you disclose information to other parties, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of such information regardless of their affiliation or relationship with Perma. Because Perma does not control the privacy practices of third-parties you are subject to the privacy customs and policies of those third-parties. When you link to another web site, you are subject to the Privacy Policy of that web site. We encourage you to ask questions and review the applicable Privacy Policy before you disclose your personal information to third-parties.</p>
<p>We do not try to control, and disclaim responsibility for, information provided by other users or third-parties that is made available through our site. Such information may contain errors, intentional or otherwise, or may be offensive, inappropriate or inaccurate, and in some cases may be mislabeled or deceptively labeled.</p>
<p>Perma uses services provided by third-party service providers CloudFare (which acts as Perma’s Content Delivery Network) and Google (e.g., Google Fonts).  You may wish to review their Privacy Policies here https://www.cloudflare.com/security-policy and here https://developers.google.com/site-policies, respectively.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>Perma may from time to time change this Privacy Policy with or without notice, so please check it regularly for any changes or updates. For future reference, Perma will make a link to the current Privacy Policy available to you when you are on our Site.</p>
